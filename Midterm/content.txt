"\nIs there any chance that the request to gather data on financial trades is implemented?  Our understanding was that the commission had no jurisdiction over financial markets.\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tFulton, Donna  \nSent:\tTuesday, June 19, 2001 9:19 AM\nTo:\tSteffes, James; Nicolay, Christi; Novosel, Sarah; Lawner, Leslie; Cantrell, Rebecca; Miller, Stephanie; Allen, Phillip K.\nCc:\tAlvarez, Ray\nSubject:\tEl Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements\n\nEl Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket.  They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:\nthe name of the counter party to the financial trade\nthe quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade\nall the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu\nthe time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates\nthe date on which the deal was entered into\nthe type of trade\n\nEl Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)\n\nI have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.  Let me know if you want a copy faxed."

"Thanks.  Sorry, we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes.  Lots of time on budgets - still continuing this week.  What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.  The \"i's\" don't have to be dotted nor the \"t's\" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.  I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable about the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .

These are my notes associated with any outstanding items requiring final review/approval:\n\nItem 1 - I have received the remainder of outstanding rates from TK and populated into the PDT records.  TK/Lindy, please provide email if corrections are necessary.\nItem 3 - After discussions with Lynn, we chose to round up Daily Max Flowing Capacity for gas days 8/1 and 8/3 (both from 1,092,956 to 1,093,000) so this would not raise questions or require footnote explanations.  I have also updated the footnotes and comments provided by Terry/Darrell/Lynn and populated accordingly into PDS and PFS.\nItem 4 - I compared the daily scheduled volumes by California delivery point provided under RP00-241-000 (CPUC vs El Paso) SCE-7 against the volumes extracted from TMS and highlighted the nine records having discrepancies, where the data to the right of the matrix is the amount reported in the prior request.  I would recommend that we adjust to the previously reported volumes.  I was not able to extract the website operational capacity volumes for each point in the West of Thoreau area; however, I did verify that the monthly Total Scheduled System Volume (PDSM) less the monthly Total Scheduled Volume at each California Point (PPSM) equaled the usage volumes billed to all customers delivering to East of California delivery points.\n\nProvide comments to the entire distribution list in this email no later than Thursday at 1pm.  \n\nOmaha - I will separate each tab and save as a separate Excel file using the file name convention as defined by the FERC.  I believe we need to provide both a hardcopy and a CD.  Is the current Excel format with headers acceptable for the hardcopy version?   Additionally, do I need to delete the headers for the electronic files on CD?  Unless otherwise instructed, I will email the final version of all four files for final disposition by Regulatory in Omaha no later than 3pm.

Most of them are single selects and could be incorporated into SQL in the Excel add-in if desired.  I thought stored procedures would make it easier to separate support for the add-in from support for the code.  The stored procedures are all on the server ETSADHOC, database adhoctest, under my id (dpowell).  I think we want to get the DBA's to move these into a production environment so they are protected (ie: dbo in the etsadhoc database)?\n\n 1.

As a follow-up to that conversation I was able to confirm that the Service Sub Type in CMS was used to differentiate PNR contracts from Packets agreements in TMS.\nPNR has No Contract \"Service Sub Type\"\nPackets have a Service Sub Type of \"A\" (Seasonal), \"B\" (Backdraft) or \"U\" (Other). The Packet activity can be combined and reported as one number. \nIn addition, I have asked Contracts to establish Service Sub Types of Traditional, Non Traditional, and Storage for Service Type: SBA Pack/Draft so that Pack & Draft activity can be reported separately from the other activity. It is my  recommendation that the SBA line on the subject report be changed to report Peak activity (Service Type: SBA Winter Peaking) separately from Traditional Pack/Draft. The Non Traditional and Storage Pack/Draft should be used in calculating the Unanticipated Swing but should not be displayed on the report.\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please call me     "

Please share this information with the Executive with which you work, as we would like to utilize every table that we buy. When an Enron employee volunteers to fill a table, we encourage them to leverage it by inviting co-workers, customers, community leaders, etc. \n \nIf you volunteer to fill a table, it is important that you immediately let me know, and I will serve as the liaison with the non-profit organization.\n\nAttached is the updated Community Relations Tables Report.

It does qualify this statement by discussing where potential bottlenecks in delivery might occur and recommends actions to address the bottlenecks.  See below for a link to the report.\n\nMary Schoen \nEnvironmental Strategies \nEnron Corp \n415.782.7803 (phone) \n415.782.7854 (fax) \n\n\nFor immediate release: October 3, 2001 \nContact: Claudia Chandler : 916-654-4989 \n\nEnergy Commission Report Projects \nImproved Natural Gas Supplies For the State \n\n\n\nSacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000's average price, the specter remains of last December, when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates. Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.\n\nThe Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified \"yes\" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.\n\nNearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.\n\nThe newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.\n\n\"This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future,\" said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.\n\nTo help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.\n\nNatural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.\n\nThe just adopted Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report can be found on the Energy Commission's Web Site at: \n\n\nwww.energy.ca.gov/contracts <<http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts>> \n\n\nOr report is attached: \n\n << File: Gas Infrastructure Report.pdf >> \n\n\n"

Officials deny price gouging.\n\nBy DOUG SMITH, RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ\nTimes Staff Writers\n\nSeptember 10 2001\n\nDuring the peak of California's power crisis, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged, according to a newly completed independent audit.\n\nThe document, obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act, seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes.\n\nThe audit also undercuts efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private, out-of-state generating companies.\n\nFor months, DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15% above its costs.\n\nAs recently as July, former DWP chief S. David Freeman, who now heads Davis' new statewide power authority, repeated that assurance in a letter to U.S. senators probing the energy meltdown.\n\nBut the audit findings show that DWP's profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56% last year under Freeman's stewardship.\n\nOverall, during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May, records show that the DWP profited $200 million on sales of $680 million. It says it is still owed $180 million.\n\nBeyond those higher profits, the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity.\n\nThey include a $34-million cut for the city's general fund--essentially a bonus for the utility's owner--and an additional $42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agency's capital investments.\n\nThese overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators.\n\nIn effect, unsuspecting ratepayers across the state, whose utilities have been battered by debt, are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay.\n\nIn an interview late last week, Freeman defended those costs and DWP's profits, saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants.\n\nHe insisted that he had issued \"standing orders\" to sell power at a profit of no more than 15%.\n\n\"We made a fair amount of money. It was not price gouging,\" said Freeman, who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year.\n\nFreeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than 15%, then \"I'm not embarrassed about it. It says nothing more than there's enterprise at [the] DWP.\"\n\nThe DWP's new general manager, David Wiggs, said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freeman's tenure.\n\n\"Maybe in hindsight,\" Wiggs said, \"it would have been better not to be so specific, but to say, 'Look we're gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers.' \"\n\nStill, Wiggs said, even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated, it was not excessive. \"We charged just and reasonable rates,\" he said, adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin.\n\nWiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity.\n\nConducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the study targeted a 13-month period beginning in May 2000. The results have provided critics with new ammunition.\n\n\"Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair,\" said Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union. \"This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks, savings and loans and insurance companies--not a public agency.\"\n\nSen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the crisis, was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWP's profits were limited to 15%.\n\n\"This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny,\" he said after learning of the audit. \"It would be ironic if it turns out that the L.A. Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov. Davis' 'Texas Pirates,' \" said Thompson.\n\nThe DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the state's deregulation of electricity began to backfire, with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding.\n\nTo keep the power flowing, the DWP--which had opted out of deregulation--cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market.\n\nThis helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced.\n\nAt the same time, however, the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis, official reports would later show. Freeman repeatedly said the utility's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly, inefficient plants.\n\nBut the audit raises such serious questions about the DWP's behavior that the matter has spilled into the 2002 gubernatorial contest.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a possible Republican challenger to Davis, last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure.\n\nIn a letter to his successor, James K. Hahn, the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling.\n\nIf so, he said, the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated $180 million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales.\n\nA Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity.\n\n\"The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales,\" said Jaime de la Vega, a senior advisor to Riordan's campaign committee.\n\nFreeman, now squarely in the Davis camp, disputes Riordan's account. He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agency's pricing strategy.\n\nHe wanted to charge more, according to Freeman, in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, which were slipping into insolvency.\n\nFreeman described Riordan's view as: \"If we're gonna continue to sell it to them, we ought to get a lot of money. He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it.\"\n\nFor the most part, the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in California's haywire energy market. Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market, including his agency.\n\nBut according to a report by the state's grid operator, DWP was one of the most aggressive, along with the trading arm of BC Hydro, the government-owned utility in British Columbia.\n\nYet another report--this one by the state's power-buying agency--found that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe report said DWP charged an average of $292 per megawatt hour, asking more than many private generators.\n\nIt could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher.\n\nEven after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year, the DWP collected profits more than 40% higher than it claimed to have netted, records show.\n\nOverall, during the 13-month period audited, profits averaged 29%, double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving.\n\nAlthough Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texas-based energy suppliers, Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government-owned utilities.\n\nOne key question is whether those agencies, like private suppliers, should be forced to refund excess profits.\n\nThe primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged.\n\nDWP insists it is outside the commission's jurisdiction. But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities.\n\nThe leading proponent of that course is state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).\n\nIn a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month, he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are \"merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in-state public utility agencies.\"\n\nThe chairman of that committee, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead.\n\nFor information about reprinting this article, go to http://www.lats.com/rights/register.htm"

(Lawrence); Sommers, Jeffrey E.; Walls J=\nr., Rob; Donahue, Jeff; Lundstrom, Bruce; Romero, Isabel\nSubject: Weekly Report\n\n\nStan/Jim,\n=20\nFollowing is a list of last week's most salient events.\n=20\nCentral America/DR:\n=20\nGuatemala:  MARAD will reply this week as to their position vis-a-vis the r=\neduction of Enron's contingent support from $28 to $10 million.  It is poss=\nible they will ask for additional information. =20\n=20\nNicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6=\n.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to swee=\np the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped b=\ny the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to re=\nimburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will=\n be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to altern=\native solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and pol=\nitical implications.\n=20\nPanama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elekt=\nra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are wor=\nth noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) wi=\nll likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its o=\nwn although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's mar=\nginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been m=\napped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit \"one-sided\" in favor of the distri=\nbutor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the =\ndistco to change terms without success. =20\n=20\nDominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationall=\ny, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel su=\npplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.=\n  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We =\nare working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues.\n=20\nEcoelectrica:\nThis week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process: =\n Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they underst=\nand that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Le=\nnders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 millio=\nn coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lend=\ners appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% o=\nf the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional=\n $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kic=\nk back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance wi=\nth QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week a=\nnd the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender=\n's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the le=\nnder group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to prov=\niding comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have =\nreviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to s=\nending their \"versions\" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday ni=\nte (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated th=\nat the documents are \"conforming\".  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to final=\nize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfillin=\ng CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we=\n can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can c=\nlose CP's by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed l=\night on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investi=\ngate further. =20\n=20\nAPACHI =20\n=20\nPhilippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and neg=\notiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fas=\nt enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event.  Nevert=\nheless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreemen=\nt date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year.=20\n=20\nGuam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting the=\nm over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the =\npotential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings h=\nave been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project. =\n=20\n=20\nChina:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely c=\nauses still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Wor=\nk on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with =\nHouston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approa=\nched us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits=\n to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayme=\nnt ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation. =20\n=20\nEurope =20\n=20\nGaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to pr=\novide limited technical support and financial services support to help put =\nin place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction act=\nivities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligatio=\nns.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guar=\nantees. =20\n=20\nTrakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good=\n meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government =\nstated they would \"clean up\" arrears but could not do so before January 200=\n2 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to wor=\nk with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the =\nlegal opinion they had sought and received didn't address the issue properl=\ny and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backin=\ng it needed to give the issue resolution.  OPIC agreed to send the Governme=\nnt \"terms of reference\" on their conceptual agreements.  On our question of=\n change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they woul=\nd expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed pos=\nition against it. =20\n=20\nSarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor's c=\nlaim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on No=\nvember 30th.   Team continues to work on sorting out technical issues at th=\ne plant, including meetings with senior Texaco officials. =20\n=20\nENS:  local team and Adam Overfield worked to resolve remaining issue over =\nfinal completion certificate.  Issue was related to CO2 emmissions on GT12 =\nvs the EPC contract parameters.  Team has convinced the lender's engineer t=\nhat issue is of no relevance.  Team is now moving to secure lender approval=\n.  This releases $1.95 million of contingent support by ENE. =20\n=20\nEurope Sales Prospects:  IPower submitted preliminary proposals for ENS and=\n Trakya, both well below expectations.\n=20\nOther:  Team is working closely with RAC to come up with updated fair marke=\nt valuations, cashflow projections by month for the quarter ended Dec. 31, =\nand revised/updated transfer restriction information.\n=20\nThanks, Mariella\n=20\nIsabel: please distribute to team as customary.\n=20\n=20\n=20\n=20\n"

This group is the smaller subset of the larger industry-wide plenary  group formed as a result of the FERC's directive to convene an Interconnection  conference to develop a consensus Interconnection Agreement and Procedures  document that all of industry would adopt. \nAs the industry plenary  session yielded as much results as could be expected in a large group setting,  the drafting committees were formed of Generators, Transmission Owners,  Transmission Dependent Utilities, and ISO/RTOs. A committee was formed for both  the drafting of the Interconnection Agreement and Procedures documents. Many of  your companies are represented on one of these committees. \nBecause the  FERC set a December 14 filing due date for a final consensus interconnection  document, we filed for an extension of time to complete the drafting process and  finalize the documents for FERC consideration. No one entity has endorsed the  document in its entirety, because drafting and negotiations are still underway.  Since the larger plenary had not had an opportunity to review the documents and  be provided a walk-through by the drafters, the request for an extension until  January 11, 2002 for which to file a final comprehensive consensus  Interconnection document was made. In addition, we filed for extension of the  ANOPR comments due date which was initially set for December 21, but has been  extended until January 25. This will allow for the larger plenary group to  reconvene the week of January 14 at FERC for a two-day session to discuss the  final workproduct. \nA notice designating the dates and times of this plenary  session will be provided at a later date. \nAnticipating our  filing of the status report and motion for extension, FERC granted both requests  for extensions to file. Attached are the status report, motions and notice  granting extension. \nIf you have an questions, please do not  hesitate to contact us at alliance@eei.org  or (202) 508-5098  \n \nTonja Wicks\nManager, Energy Supply Policy\nAlliance of Energy  Suppliers\nEdison Electric Institute\nPhone: (202) 508-5098\nFax: (202)  508-5600\nFax: (202) 508-5445\n - Interconnection Status Report.pdf \n - Notice granting extension.pdf \n - Alliance of Energy Suppliers.vcf "

ExxonMobil, Shell,=\n=20\nand Chevron have all missed output targets, despite the incentive of two=20\nyears of high oil prices. ExxonMobil planned a 3% annual growth target last=\n=20\nyear but its output for the second quarter of 2001 was flat versus a year=\n=20\nago. Shell reported that its 2nd quarter production increased by only 1%,=\n=20\nwell short of the 5% target. Depletion from existing oil fields runs at an=\n=20\naverage rate of about 5% per year, and that has to be replaced by an=20\nequivalent amount of new production just to keep output steady. From 1998 t=\no=20\n2000 the six biggest publicly traded companies largely failed to replace th=\ne=20\noil and natural gas they produced with new reserves, after stripping out th=\ne=20\neffect of acquisitions and revisions, according to Andersen management=20\nconsulting. BP posted one of the best performances, replacing 200% of its=\n=20\nnatural gas production and 86% of its oil. Shell replaced only 42% of its=\n=20\nnatural gas and 55% of its oil, according to Andersen. BP has set the most=\n=20\nambitious production growth target of 5.5% for this year up 7% for the long=\ner=20\nterm.\n=20\nFrom http://www.enerfax.com (Sunday, August 19, 2001):\n=20\nNatural Gas Futures Dip Lower\n    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.064 l=\nower Friday to $3.303 per MMBtu as traders squared short positions now that=\n Tropical Storm Chantal will miss the GulfCoast. The October contract lost =\n$0.081 to $3.334 per MMBtu. Tropical Storm Chantal will affect the YucatanP=\neninsulaearly this week and then move into the central Gulf but is a noneve=\nnt. Some traders wanted their positions cleared in preparation for next wee=\nk's AGA storage report as they do not trust last week's reported build of j=\nust 3 Bcf, and believe that the AGA may report a higher build this week to =\ncompensate. A lot of traders got burned by last week's report and are begin=\nning to doubt the whole system. But, others look at the data as just a one-=\nweek blip brought about by a crescendo of events that no longer exist and d=\no represent not a long-term shift. However, if Wednesday's AGA injection is=\n low again this week, look for the market to rally to a higher level, but i=\nn the meantime it will be controlled by the storm entering the Gulf of Mexi=\nco. Look for support in the $3.15-$3.20 range and again at $3.00. Resistanc=\ne is pegged at $3.40 and again around $3.60. Natural gas for next day deliv=\nery across the USand Canadawas generally $0.10 - $0.20 lower Friday. Natura=\nl gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dropped $0.20 to $3.24 per MMB=\ntu.\n=20\nGulf South Hold Open Season for Gulf Pines Pipeline=20\n   =20\n    Gulf South Pipeline is planning to build a pipeline extending from Mobi=\nleBayto North Carolinaif it receives enough interest. An open season for ca=\npacity on the Gulf Pines Pipeline is being currently being held. Gulf South=\n Pipeline, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, is owned by Entergy-Koch. If com=\npleted, Gulf Pines would be 600 - 700 miles long, and would extend through =\nGeorgia, South Carolinaand North Carolina. Anticipating an in-service date =\nof summer 2004, Gulf South is soliciting binding and non-binding bids for c=\napacity on Gulf Pines through September 19th. The pipeline would offer an i=\nnterconnection with Gulf South near MobileBay, allowing customers to source=\n supply from Texasand Louisianaas well as from MobileBay. The Gulf South sy=\nstem also offers links to major storage and supply hubs.\n=20\nGas Daily reports this proposed pipeline may have a capacity of 1 bcf per d=\nay.  It also gives the following website for additional information:  http:=\n//www.gulfpinespipeline.com .\n=20\nNatural Gas Market Ponders Storage Report\n =20\n    While some were questioning the accuracy of this week's astonishingly l=\now natural gas storage report, others blamed Tropical Storm Barry and highe=\nr demands from new power generation load. However, both the futures and cas=\nh markets jumped. Futures closed up $0.374 the day the report was announced=\n, and the cash market rose $0.20 - $0.40 the day after. Some chose to not b=\nelieve the 3 Bcf storage fill reported by the AGA, chalking it up to bad da=\nta. The average amount injected during a week in August is over 60 Bcf. The=\n prior week's fill was 80 Bcf. Factoring in Barry and the prolonged heat wa=\nve that week, the market had been expecting a somewhat lower number, but al=\nl had predicted something above 50 Bcf. There are various reports and theor=\nies. Buyers for northeastern utilities said they had all injected and were =\nshocked by the minus 12 Bcf storage number reported for the East. They coul=\nd not entirely dismiss it, however. They noted that in the last 4 years all=\n the new plants that have been built are natural gas only facilities. Last =\nweek could have been a good indication of what that could mean to the marke=\nt. The AGA says they checked and re-checked when they came up with the unbe=\nlievable number. The AGA's numbers have always lined up with the more exten=\nsive EIA reports. It is possible that a number of factors came together all=\n at once, with the impact of Barry on production and an higher generation l=\noads because of Eastern heat wave. However, the curve in the cash market ha=\ns been going down. That may mean that if there is a market opportunity to m=\nove volumes from storage to a consumer right now, that could be done, assum=\ning 4 or 5 weeks later it could be replaced at the same price or maybe even=\n less. Also, there is speculation that the pipelines were re-packing their =\nlines with volumes out of storage because of a sudden draw down.\n=20\nZiff Energy Group to Hold Conference In Portland\n=20\nCurrent Realities, Future Expectations\nPacific NorthwestGas Strategies Conference\nOctober 2,2001Portland,Oregon(at the Hilton Portland)\nHear Commissioner Wilson Condon, State of Alaska, describe how Alaskagas su=\npply will energize the Pacific Northwestsupply portfolio.

Ho=\nwever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=\ntermination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =\nplatform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =\nThere should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=\nourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=\nhe parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=\nC orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=\n).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=\nodel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =\na joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=\nrties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=\nmmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=\ntive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=\n will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=\nr recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=\n would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=\nype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=\nested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=\n the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=\nr participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  Wh=\nile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad=\nopt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day =\n2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).\n=20\nThe attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G=\nrid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (with=\nout any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed cha=\nnges to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:\n\nShe recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest=20\nShe encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr=\nocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, r=\negardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC=20\nHer opinion is that the \"Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s=\nponsored) Model\" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion managemen=\nt) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements=\n of Order No. 2000 based on a \"best practices\" analysis of other RTOs and C=\nommission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid =\nmodel. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et=\nal.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) =\nin her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i=\ns not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy=\nsical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a=\nnd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib=\nilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20\nGrid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =\nan enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was a=\ndded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow=\nner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission =\nsolutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would a=\ndminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission=\n system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra=\nnsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She str=\nongly encourages this split.=20\nGood stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) =\nand an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets=20\nAllows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), wi=\nth RTO oversight=20\nDescribes that control area operators will initially maintain their control=\n areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pur=\nsuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that con=\nsolidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be=\n subject to further discussion)=20\nRTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including=\n rate changes and tariff filings=20\nAll load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has=\n appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their =\nrights should they win on appeal)=20\n4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and G=\nridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant t=\nransmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existin=\ng facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those abo=\nve).  There will be one \"through and out rate\", plus a Grid Management Char=\nge for RTO operation.=20\nEncourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT=20\nFinancial Rights/LMP (includes \"real time spot market\") is clearly the pref=\nerred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many =\ndetails need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parti=\nes to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH). =\n Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation, auction and =\nnon-discriminatory release.  The Grid model includes a \"balancing resource\"=\n requirement that we will provide comments against=20\nWill allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be=\n supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market=\n establishment=20\nRTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC=20\nRTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder=\n process=20\nNumerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functio=\nns (all of our comments from last week's response are included)=20\nJudge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many a=\nre still concerned that FERC had not conducted a \"cost-benefit\" analysis an=\nd had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to=\n the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the \"economies of s=\ncale\" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. =\n In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process=\n that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin=\ng:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo=\nwed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t=\nransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a=\nssets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re=\ntail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to u=\ntilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners=\n.\n\nI think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the =\nextremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant \"jump sta=\nrt\" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud=\nge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the in=\nitial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a \"b=\nest practices\" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L=\nMP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b=\noard structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant=\n stakeholder advisory process.  The Commission should consider utilize the =\nfundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a mini=\nmum, consider similar mediated \"jump starts.\"=20\n\n=20\n=20\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: Bobbie McCartney [mailto:bobbie.mccartney@ferc.fed.us]\nSent: Monday, September 10, 2001 4:05 PM\nTo: mddesselle@aep.com; john.a.cohen@bakernet.com; mcrosswh@balch.com; dex@=\nbbrslaw.com; FHR@bbrslaw.com; fochsenhirt@bbrslaw.com; mrossi@bdrnet.com; j=\nlphillips@calpine.com; JRegnery@calpine.com; tkaslow@calpine.com; OHaraC@ds=\nmo.com; mary.doyle@dynegy.com; jhughes@elcon.org; Nicolay, Christi L.; JCas=\nhin@epsa.org; charles_askey@fpl.com; steved@gdsassoc.com; GHobday@HHLAW.com=\n; jschneid@huberlaw.com; richard.spring@kcpl.com; jpalermo@kemaconsulting.c=\nom; RLAMKIN@LLGM.com; relliott@mbolaw.com; beth.bradley@mirant.com; ndaggs@=\nmwe.com; paul.savage@nrgenergy.com; ron_lanclos@oxy.com; billdegrandis@paul=\nhastings.com; MaryCochran@psc.state.ar.us; Pauline.Foley@pseg.com; linxwile=\nrj@safferassoc.com; twoodbury@seminole-electric.com; bobg@sepa.doe.gov; lee=\nr@sepa.doe.gov; msmith@sf-firm.com; GLBERNST@skadden.com; gary.newell@spieg=\nelmcd.com; nbrown@spp.org; dacrabtree@tecoenergy.com; jrdalrymple@tva.gov; =\njpwest@westlawpc.com; Jane.Mudgett@Williams.com; SMALL@wrightlaw.com\nCc: Herbert Tate; Jonathan Siems; Laura Sheppeard\nSubject: RE: Final SE RTO Mediation Report\n\n\nPursuant to the agreement of the parties, service of the attached document =\nis hereby effected on this Restricted Service List, which has been previous=\nly approved in this Docket, via this email. =20\n=20\nPlease  note that there are a total of six attachments, only five of which =\ncan be sent via email.

"one more to print\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tNovosel, Sarah  \nSent:\tTuesday, September 18, 2001 8:36 AM\nTo:\tKean, Steven J.; Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Nicolay, Christi L.; Lindberg, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Fulton, Donna; Alvarez, Ray; Connor, Joe; Staines, Dan; Stroup, Kerry; Migden, Janine; Walton, Steve; Comnes, Alan; Mara, Susan; Maurer, Luiz; Philipp, Meredith\nCc:\tAllegretti, Daniel; Hoatson, Tom; Fromer, Howard\nSubject:\tNortheast RTO Mediation Report\n\nYesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is \"subject to extension\" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.\n\nOne good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a \"business plan\" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.\n\nMarket Design\n\nAt the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (\"Option 1-M\"of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (\"Option 2-M\" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (\"Option 3-M\" of the Business Plan).  \n\nWe took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  \n\nAs noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining \"Best Practices.\"  Although PJM also conducted a \"best practices\" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are \"best practices.\"  \n\nThe Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) \"far outstrips\" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that \"impatience, haste and greed\" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process \"at the expense of sound policy\" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to \"exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint.\" See Report, page 18.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.\n\nPJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  \n\nNY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  \n\nWe support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.\n\nPost Mediation\n\nThe Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  \n\nThe Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.\n\nAlthough we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.\n\nPlease call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.\n\nSarah, Dan, Howard and Tom\n\n \t\t \n\n"

I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.\n\nUnfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.\n\nI would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.\n\nthanks\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tEnron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Ken Lay-@ENRON\nSent:\tThursday, September 20, 2001 10:25 PM\nTo:\tAll Enron Worldwide@ENRON\nSubject:\tMedia Reports\n\n\nAs you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.

"I like our traditional measurment better.   This is good data, but is more relevant for cash traders than term traders.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tHayden, Frank  \nSent:\tThursday, June 21, 2001 11:29 AM\nTo:\tPresto, Kevin M.\nSubject:\tPerf Reports - Baseball Stats\n\nKevin,\nBelow find your regions performance broken into  \"baseball stats\".  These numbers where generated off daily pnl's and would include reserves released, etc.\n\n?\tTransactional batting average is given the number of days (103), how many times did you show a profit on your daily pnl statement.  Keep in mind two things, a batting average of 300 is considered great in baseball. However, tossing a coin gives a 50/50.  Given that these numbers are daily pnl's and not trading strategies (strategies, you get to pick your pitch), I think the coin toss is the better measure.  With this in mind, anything above 50/50 reflects intellectual capital (research) at work.  If the average is significantly below 50/50, the suggestion would be to improve fundamental analysis.\n?\tDollar weighted batting average is the absolute dollars made divided by absolute dollars made and lost.  Differences between transactional batting average and dollar weighted batting average are attributed to trading discipline.\n?\tWin/loss ratio is total dollars made vs. total dollars lost.  This ratio says that for every dollar bet, how much paid.\n?\tTrading efficiency reflects the ratio average wins vs. average losses.  A \"pos\" shows that average wins exceed average loss.  The important note here is that the larger the win/loss ratio, the greater the trading efficiency, i.e. letting profits run while cutting losses early.  \"Neg\" efficiency implies that the trader holds onto his losses too long.\n\nDoes this add any insight into your portfolio?\n\n\nFrank\n\n << File: Eastbb.xls >> \n\n \n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Metafile)>"

I wanted to give you some\ninitial reactions, and hope that you will call to discuss your reaactions to\nmy reactions (if that make sense to you).\n\nIn looking at the MSHA data under a finer and finer slice, I was somewhat\nsurprised to see the purging of employees in NAPP and CAPP. I have also been\nmaking the rounds in the major NAPP and CAPP basins to gauge the level of\nnew activity, but it is surprising how sluggish the rebound is and will be.\nOne could write that off to new problems with permitting (intermittent\nstreams has become a real problem I am told) and/or to hiring problems while\nfighting off the coal unions some more. The other theory is that this\noligopology that has gotten its sea legs! I am leaning towards a theory that\nthe latter will use the former for cover. Given how bad EIA is, that cover\ncould last a while. This market is ripe for a squeezing IF gas tightens a\nbit and net exports is somewhat inelastic at these levels!\n\nFurther, it appears clear that aside from being horrible at managing data\nand the needs of the public, EIA is incompetent at analysis. I do not think\nwe built inventory during 1Q01; it was mostly stocks (producer/distributor)\nmoving to market. I now understand why you were focusing upon my gas\nsubstitution comments. The other area of opportunity is EXIM. No doubt you\nhave continued to see the drift in international freight and coal prices.\nHow low can it go (EXIM) - we are in unchartered territory!

"Our marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s).   I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything.  We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth.\n\nRather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market.   We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.\n\nAm I making sense?   In addition, I am working with Doug to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks).   We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.\n\nWith respect to NE, the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak, therefore, in some ways the risk is easier to manage.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tHerndon, Rogers  \nSent:\tWednesday, August 22, 2001 10:12 AM\nTo:\tPresto, Kevin M.\nSubject:\tRE: Request for Information/Status Report\n\nso, should I shut down our retail offerings in those regions.  otherwise, i am compounding the problem as ees is selling off of the marks?\n\nRH\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tPresto, Kevin M.  \nSent:\tWednesday, August 22, 2001 10:08 AM\nTo:\tHerndon, Rogers\nSubject:\tRE: Request for Information/Status Report\n\nWe are in jail in off-peak as well and are trying to buy.

I wanted to give you some\ninitial reactions, and hope that you will call to discuss your reaactions to\nmy reactions (if that make sense to you).\n\nIn looking at the MSHA data under a finer and finer slice, I was somewhat\nsurprised to see the purging of employees in NAPP and CAPP. I have also been\nmaking the rounds in the major NAPP and CAPP basins to gauge the level of\nnew activity, but it is surprising how sluggish the rebound is and will be.\nOne could write that off to new problems with permitting (intermittent\nstreams has become a real problem I am told) and/or to hiring problems while\nfighting off the coal unions some more. The other theory is that this\noligopology that has gotten its sea legs! I am leaning towards a theory that\nthe latter will use the former for cover. Given how bad EIA is, that cover\ncould last a while. This market is ripe for a squeezing IF gas tightens a\nbit and net exports is somewhat inelastic at these levels!\n\nFurther, it appears clear that aside from being horrible at managing data\nand the needs of the public, EIA is incompetent at analysis. I do not think\nwe built inventory during 1Q01; it was mostly stocks (producer/distributor)\nmoving to market. I now understand why you were focusing upon my gas\nsubstitution comments. The other area of opportunity is EXIM. No doubt you\nhave continued to see the drift in international freight and coal prices.\nHow low can it go (EXIM) - we are in unchartered territory!

This is for informational purposes only.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or need clarification on any points.  \n\nOver the last few weeks, a few of us have been working to test an EES deal in Enpower (St. Luke's - Roosevelt, part of the Beth Israel deal).  The deal is a fixed price sale in New York City (Zone J) of Energy, Line Losses, Ancillary's, and ICAP.  The T&D is a pass through.  We only tested one site out of the ten.  Needless to say, this is probably one of the simplest structures available.  Obviously, we have worked on a few other things at the same time, so it has taken longer than we expected, but I hope this will help highlight how difficult it is to book EES deals in Enpower in it's current state.\n\nQuick statistics for ONE site:\n\nEach month of hourly data, takes 5-6 minutes to save.  We booked 100 months (approx 8.3 years), therefore each deal type (energy, ancillary, etc.) took 8-9 hours to book.\nSince each deal type takes 8-9 hours to book, it takes a total of 25-26 hours to book energy, ancillary's (only 1), line losses, and ICAP (this is not booked hourly, therefore, it only takes 1 hour to book).\nAlthough we booked only one ancillary position, most markets have at least four, therefore the total booking time should be closer to 50 hours.\nOnce we got a book to run, it took 25 minutes to calculate the value.\nAll of the above statistics assume there are no errors in entering the deals.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nWork with Anthony Dayao to set up a system that can handle these trades for position management, valuation, reporting, scheduling, settlements, accounting, etc.\nIn the interim:\n\nEnhance RPS to make the valuation consistent with the batch valuation process.  This includes strengthening information for position and DPR reporting.  As well, create tools to help identify change in valuation due to curve shift, reg switch options, and new deals.\nEnhance Intramonth valuation and reporting (East desk does not currently have an intramonth book).\nIntegrate the Tariff Valuation and Reporting.  Currently, this is done in a stand-alone spreadsheet application.\nSupport the Curve Database project which will allow the breakdown of curves into its components (as opposed to current bundled curves).\nMove all the EPMI hedges to Enpower.  All hedges will become desk to desk instead of being entered in both RPS and Enpower.  Position and P&L reports will have be integrated between Enpower and RPS. \t\n\n\nHere is a breakdown of what it took to 'rebook' this trade:\n\nWeek 1 (May 14-18)\n\nRead Contract.\nGet Batch model, as well as a breakdown of value between Energy, Ancillary's, etc.\nSit with Underwriting to answer questions about Load growth and contractual questions.\nWork on Wholesale Full Requirements model (in Excel) to check valuation.\n\nWeek 2 (May 21-25)\n\nContinue working on Full Requirements model.\nWork with Risk Management (Stacey White's group) to set up delivery points and curves in Enpower.\t\nBegin to book deal in Enpower - Getting access to Enpower took some time.\nDiscovered that our assumption on hours for the 12x12 was incorrect.   We had gotten about 1/3 of the deal booked by the time we realized this.\nAt times, the database tables would run out of space, because we have never entered a deal of this size in the test database.  This would keep us from entering any new data.\n\nWeek 3 (May 29-June 1)\n\nFinished Excel Full Requirements model.  The EES Batch and the Wholesale model tie out except for some minor differences on discounting and ICAP.  The current ICAP curves are            $/MW-day, and they are not calculated using the correct numbers of days (i.e. June and July have the same MW/day price, even though there are 30 and 31 days, respectively, in each month).  This can be fixed in the curve files.  In the future we should mark the curves as $/Kw-month.\nAgain, we ran into problems with the test database.\nCompleted booking in Enpower.\n\nWeek 4 (June 4-5)\n\nTook 2 days to get a MTM valuation (portcalc) to work.\nDiscovered deal entry errors in booking.\n\n\n\n\t"

Ho=\nwever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=\ntermination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =\nplatform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =\nThere should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=\nourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=\nhe parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=\nC orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=\n).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=\nodel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =\na joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=\nrties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=\nmmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=\ntive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=\n will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=\nr recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=\n would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=\nype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=\nested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=\n the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=\nr participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  Wh=\nile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad=\nopt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day =\n2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).\n=20\nThe attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G=\nrid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (with=\nout any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed cha=\nnges to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:\n\nShe recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest=20\nShe encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr=\nocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, r=\negardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC=20\nHer opinion is that the \"Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s=\nponsored) Model\" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion managemen=\nt) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements=\n of Order No. 2000 based on a \"best practices\" analysis of other RTOs and C=\nommission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid =\nmodel. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et=\nal.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) =\nin her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i=\ns not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy=\nsical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a=\nnd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib=\nilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20\nGrid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =\nan enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was a=\ndded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow=\nner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission =\nsolutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would a=\ndminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission=\n system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra=\nnsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She str=\nongly encourages this split.=20\nGood stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) =\nand an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets=20\nAllows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), wi=\nth RTO oversight=20\nDescribes that control area operators will initially maintain their control=\n areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pur=\nsuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that con=\nsolidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be=\n subject to further discussion)=20\nRTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including=\n rate changes and tariff filings=20\nAll load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has=\n appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their =\nrights should they win on appeal)=20\n4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and G=\nridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant t=\nransmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existin=\ng facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those abo=\nve).  There will be one \"through and out rate\", plus a Grid Management Char=\nge for RTO operation.=20\nEncourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT=20\nFinancial Rights/LMP (includes \"real time spot market\") is clearly the pref=\nerred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many =\ndetails need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parti=\nes to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH). =\n Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation, auction and =\nnon-discriminatory release.  The Grid model includes a \"balancing resource\"=\n requirement that we will provide comments against=20\nWill allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be=\n supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market=\n establishment=20\nRTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC=20\nRTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder=\n process=20\nNumerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functio=\nns (all of our comments from last week's response are included)=20\nJudge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many a=\nre still concerned that FERC had not conducted a \"cost-benefit\" analysis an=\nd had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to=\n the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the \"economies of s=\ncale\" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. =\n In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process=\n that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin=\ng:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo=\nwed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t=\nransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a=\nssets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re=\ntail open access (concerns with Cal.)

Reporting Requirements NOPR\n\nToday's EPSA conference call was well-attended and the participants seemed to agree that the status quo (i.e., making relatively limited paper filings of transactional information) is much preferable to the more extensive electronic posting that FERC is proposing.  Admittedly, though, some of what FERC is proposing seems to be justified -- for example, the FPA requires every public utility to show rates and charges in the form prescribed by the Commission, which gives the Commission a lot of latitude.  \n\nThe basic conclusion was that EPSA's filing should make the point that FERC should be able to find a way to meet its Section 205-c obligations in a way that is not potentially commercially damaging to market participants.  Also, FERC may be overreaching in requesting data that does not pertain to physical transactions.  Additionally, there was some discussion of requesting confidential treatment of the information to be posted.  EPSA will draft comments with the assistance of outside counsel, Dickstein Shapiro.  A draft will be circulated and if any of you are not on the EPSA distribution list I will make sure you get a copy.\n\nElizabeth and others, we have already discussed the importance of Enron weighing in separately in this proceeding.  Since comments are due October 5, I believe at this point it would be prudent to call our outside counsel so that we can begin the drafting process.\n\nSSL"

With the House pushing the vote unt=\nil October, it lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the likelihood that a bill w=\nill be done this year.\n=20\nWays and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA), who is taking the lead for the =\nHouse Republicans, has vowed to spend more time working with Democrats to c=\nraft a bipartisan product.  Ways and Means Ranking Member Carl Levin (D-MI)=\n has not yet introduced his bill.  He is still meeting with Democrats and h=\nas stated that he wants to introduce the most \"balanced\" bill he can that w=\nill include labor and environmental provisions. =20\n=20\nThe Administration continues to push hard for TPA.  They have made securing=\n trade promotion authority their chief trade objective this year.  Presiden=\nt Bush recently said that he wants TPA before the World Trade Organization =\nministerial in November.\n=20\nBANKRUPTCY REFORM\n=20\nHouse and Senate Conferees are hoping that conflicts between the House and =\nSenate versions of the Bankruptcy Reform bill will be worked out expeditiou=\nsly.  House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R-MI), who is chair of =\nthe Conference, has stated that the Conference will meet formally for the f=\nirst time next week.\n=20\nThere are two sections of the Bankruptcy Reform bill that have significant =\nimportance to Enron: 1. financial contract netting provisions, which are in=\ncluded in both the House and Senate versions; and 2. a technical correction=\ns amendment regarding production payments, which is currently included in t=\nhe House version only. =20\n=20\nThere are 32 members of the House and Senate who have been appointed to the=\n Conference, which is unusually large.  The Conference has to deal with 38 =\namendments that the Senate made to the House bill (including the technical =\ncorrections amendment regarding production payments).  The Administration h=\nas some problems with the bill, none that pertain to our issues.  The progr=\ness is expected to be slow.\n=20\nFY 2002 TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS - MEXICO TRUCKING BAN\n=20\nJust prior to the adjournment for the August Recess, the Senate passed the =\nFY 02 Transportation bill, which contained provisions that called for stric=\nt safety standards for Mexico trucks gaining unrestricted access to U.S. ro=\nads.  Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Senator John McCain (R-AZ) both vehemen=\ntly oppose the restrictive language but in the end allowed a final vote on =\nthe appropriations measure.  They have vowed, however, to hold the bill up =\nin the House-Senate Conference until the Mexico trucking language is resolv=\ned (note: the House prohibitive language is more restrictive, effectively p=\nrohibiting Mexico trucks from ever going beyond the current 20-mile radius =\nthey now have access to).  The White House has, on several occasions, reite=\nrated their objection to any language in the bill that would halt or slow d=\nown NAFTA provisions allowing cross-border transit, which were to have been=\n enacted January 1, 2001 - making the provision well-behind schedule alread=\ny.\n=20\nWhile the Mexico's Economic Minister has stated that he would not seek sanc=\ntions against the United States for violations of the NAFTA, Mexico Preside=\nnt Vincente Fox has stated that he would consider limiting or even prohibit=\ning U.S. trucks on Mexico's roads.  A recent study indicated that the U.S.'=\ns failure to execute the cross-border transit provisions of NAFTA could cos=\nt Mexico's economy upwards of $100 billion per year. =20\n=20\nThe Senate and House will now go to conference on the measure, and it's exp=\nected to be a contentious debate in Conference. =20\n=20\nMINIMUM WAGE HIKE\n=20\nThe House will likely act on a minimum wage measure following Senate action=\n, which is expected this fall.  House Republican leaders are insisting, how=\never, that any increase in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax breaks fo=\nr small businesses.  Additionally, it is likely that the minimum wage bill =\nwill be a vehicle for other business tax credits and pro-business measures.=\n =20\n=20\nSenate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) said that the Democratic minimum =\nwage bill will come to the floor in the fall.  It is expected, however, tha=\nt Senate Republicans will attempt to add several tax cuts, which Democrats =\nwould oppose unless there are offsets (meaning, the tax measures would have=\n to be paid for elsewhere in the budget). =20\n=20\nThe White House has said it favors a minimum wage increase providing it con=\ntains flexibility provisions.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.\nHere is a summary of the paper:\n        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.\n        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry. \n        Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.\n        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:  \nMaintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.  \nEnsure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.  \nEncourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).  \nCreate honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.  \nEncourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.  \nCreate efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.  \nMonitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).  \n\n        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options. \n        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time. \n        Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices. \n        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. \nEric\n----------------------------------------------\nEric Hirst \nConsulting in Electric-Industry Restructuring\n106 Capital Circle\nOak Ridge, TN 37830\n(865-482-5470 (phone & fax)    :Eric@EHirst.comhttp://www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> "

If not, can we develop rather quickly?\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tShelk, John  \nSent:\tThursday, August 16, 2001 3:05 PM\nTo:\tShapiro, Richard; Robertson, Linda; Steffes, James D.; Nicolay, Christi L.; Novosel, Sarah; Briggs, Tom; Alvarez, Ray; Shortridge, Pat; Long, Chris; Nersesian, Carin\nSubject:\tReport on \"Anti-RTO Bill\" and on Andy Black Meeting\n\n\nThis note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall.\n\n1.  H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC))\n\nOn Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess), the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814, the Interstate Transmission Act.  The legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs.  Also objectionable is that the bill would \"limit\" pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a \"reasonable transition mechanism or period\" for additive charges.  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO.  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any RTO.\n\nIn addition to the RTO language, the bill has the \"old\" version of the NERC reliability legislation in it.  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs, repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company.\n\nBarbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district.  Rep. Burr is from North Carolina, so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him.  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue.  Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below).\n\n2.  Andy Black Meeting\n\nAndy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation.  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron, Reliant, Dynegy and TXU.  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day.  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes, the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment.  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill, the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee.  Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues.\n\na.   RTOs\n\nChairman Barton supports RTOs.  At a minimum, the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested.  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation.  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs.  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  However, Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above, which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs.  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs.  Hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects.  I will strongly encourage him to \"do the right thing\" in that regard.\n\nb.   PUHCA\n\nThe draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101).  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill.  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate.\n\nc.  PURPA\n\nProspective repeal.  On back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state.\n\nd.   Interconnection\n\nThey have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like.  I am contacting EPSA to get the details.\n\ne.   Net Metering\n\nThey are likely to include the Inslee bill to require \"net metering.\"  I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve; that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday).  I need to get more information to Andy.\n\nf.   Transmission Jurisdiction\n\nThankfully, Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction.  Specifically, the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.\n\ng.   Siting\n\nOn siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.\n\nh.   Reliability\n\nOn a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.\n\ni.   Negawatts\n\nI raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the \"California bill\" earlier this summer.\n\nYour questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome."

Reporting Requirements NOPR\n\nToday's EPSA conference call was well-attended and the participants seemed to agree that the status quo (i.e., making relatively limited paper filings of transactional information) is much preferable to the more extensive electronic posting that FERC is proposing.  Admittedly, though, some of what FERC is proposing seems to be justified -- for example, the FPA requires every public utility to show rates and charges in the form prescribed by the Commission, which gives the Commission a lot of latitude.  \n\nThe basic conclusion was that EPSA's filing should make the point that FERC should be able to find a way to meet its Section 205-c obligations in a way that is not potentially commercially damaging to market participants.  Also, FERC may be overreaching in requesting data that does not pertain to physical transactions.  Additionally, there was some discussion of requesting confidential treatment of the information to be posted.  EPSA will draft comments with the assistance of outside counsel, Dickstein Shapiro.  A draft will be circulated and if any of you are not on the EPSA distribution list I will make sure you get a copy.\n\nElizabeth and others, we have already discussed the importance of Enron weighing in separately in this proceeding.

"I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.\n\nWhile the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge=\nnerators \"may\" have withheld power, the basic argument is that \"DEREGULATIO=\nN ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED.\"   In addition, the paper=\n states that \"MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE=\nS TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICIT=\nY DEREGULATION.\"\n\nIn addition, California's response of \"DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -=\n- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS=\n.\"\n\nI hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat=\n on the Refund case.

In re=\nviewing this paper several things struck me.  The paper is not particularly=\n accurate, they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse, they ign=\nore the lack of implementation of demand-side response programs that were s=\nupposed to be a integral part of the AB1890 and they use inappropriate term=\ns, such as \"Idle\" when describing plants that were unavailable because of m=\naintenance or repair.\n\nMy reason for writing is to ask you, how politically influential is a paper=\n like this?  Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on =\nproblems, especially with those associated with the problems experienced in=\n CA?

Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.\n\nThe Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified \"yes\" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.\n\nNearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.\n\nThe newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.\n\n\"This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future,\" said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.\n\nTo help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.\n\nNatural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.\n\nThe just adopted Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report can be found on the Energy Commission's Web Site at:\n\n\nwww.energy.ca.gov/contracts\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTo unsubscribe from this list, please go to:\n\nhttp://www.energy.ca.gov/listservers/\n\nOr simply send an e-mail to majordomo@energy.ca.gov\nand in the body of the e-mail, type in\n\nunsubscribe (name of this list)\n\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nFarideh Namjou\nWeb Development Team\nCalifornia Energy Commission\n916-654-4989\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"

The paper is\navailable on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com\n<http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on\nthe paper.\n\nHere is a summary of the paper:\n\n        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter\nelectricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public\nUtilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring\ncompetitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and\nmore choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy\nsuppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.\n\n        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April\n1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster\nfor California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.\nPart of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable\nconcern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity\nindustry. \n\n        Although a few states have decided, based on the California\nexperience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.\nInstead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are\nthat competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for\nCalifornia's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and\nprices affect market outcomes.\n\n        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity\nregulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred\nbeginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance\nto other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity\nindustry. This section makes several points: \n\n*\tMaintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new\ngeneration to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned\nto meet growing loads. \n\n*\tEnsure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural\ngas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,\nmaintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large\nregional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. \n\n*\tEncourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and\nvoluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale\nmarkets). \n\n*\tCreate honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with\nartificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to\noffer retail services without favoring individual competitors. \n\n*\tEncourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply\nand price risks. \n\n*\tCreate efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,\nancillary services, and transmission congestion. \n\n*\tMonitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and\nvertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and\ntransmission). \n\n\n        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and\nprices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer\nefficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve\nreliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing\noptions. \n\n        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is\nturning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because\nelectricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is\nour most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy\nto operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a\nreal-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the\nsame time. \n\n        Although the problems that have occurred in California are\nsubstantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should\nfocus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and\naccept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to\nrecognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond\nthe boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and\nwholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to\nhave competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces\ntime varying prices. \n\n        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for\nwholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will\nenjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and\nprice-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability\nservices will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,\nand the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants\nwill be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. \n\nEric\n----------------------------------------------\nEric Hirst \nConsulting in Electric-Industry Restructuring\n106 Capital Circle\nOak Ridge, TN 37830\n*865-482-5470 (phone & fax)    *Eric@EHirst.com\nhttp://www.EHirst.com <http://www.ehirst.com/> "

Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report (123 pages).  There's an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages.  Although, as stated in the summary, the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices, they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices.  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter.  I'll keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting.  gh\n\n\n\nIN NEW REPORT, CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY\nConstrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas\nprices in California last fall and winter, according to a report issued last week by a committee of the\nCalifornia Energy Commission. The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the\nissue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state.\nAfter taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others,\nthe report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved. ?Insufficient receipt capacity\nwithin California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso [Natural Gas Co.] pipeline system both contrib-uted\nto the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000,? the Sept. 24 report said. The CEC is\nscheduled to vote Wednesday on the report.\nThe revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame\nentirely on that, noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels\nduring times of high gas prices. ?As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California,\nbuyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other. Whether prices during this period were, in\nwhole or in part, the result of a free market?s rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium, or\nentirely the result of price manipulation, is beyond the scope of this report,? wrote Commissioner Michal\nMoore, presiding member of CEC?s electricity and natural gas committee.\nPointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint (RP00-241) against El Paso Corp. pending at FERC, the\nCEC added that it had ?every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented\nby the CPUC.?\nThe report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El\nPaso system in recent years. ?The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California, and not the upstream\ncustomers. This is due, in part, to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to\nfirm capacity on the El Paso system. It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment\nto deliver capacity paid for by California,? the report noted.\nMoore?s committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version\nfrom the CPUC, The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co., which all called for\nconsideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California (IF, 27 Aug,\n1). The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the\nrange of 15% to 20% (IF, 13 Aug, 4).\nThe report went on to suggest that California ?can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a\nregulated, cost-plus environment. Under price regulation, adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme\ntemperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes. Under today?s conditions, that is no longer the case.?\nMoore added that the state?s ?virtual complete reliance? on gas for electric generation has contributed to\nthe new dynamics surrounding capacity planning.\nMore than 100,000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council\nregion demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid, the report continued, saying the CEC was ?encour-aged?\nby recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERC?s stated intent to expedite\nreview of such proposals. The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co. is developing 375,000 Mcf/\nday of additional receipt capacity, which should be ready by the end of the year. Also, Pacific Gas and Electric\nCo. plans to add as much as 600,000 Mcf/day of capacity by 2003, according to the report.\nIt observed that intrastate pipelines, in particular those in Southern California, ran at close to full\ncapacity at times this and last year, which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate\npipelines to gas consumers, including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001.\nHigh prices in the future could be held at bay with the in-state expansions and the CPUC?s recent approval\nof SoCal Gas? plan to remove 37 Bcf of cushion and working gas from three storage fields in Montebello and\nAliso Canyon in Los Angeles County and La Goleta in Santa Barbara County (IF, 2 July, 3).\nIn addition to strongly emphasizing intrastate needs, the report recommended that the state ?analyze\nthe consequences of the increasing upstream gas demands on the El Paso pipeline system as they affect the\nflows of natural gas and electricity? between California and the Southwest U.S. and Mexico.\nAccording to the report, the state also should: encourage in-state gas production; re-evaluate design criteria\nfor the intrastate system in consideration of growing power generation demand; consider gas curtailment\nmechanisms; ?optimize? storage; and encourage the creation of new storage facilities in the state.\nThe 123-page report is available on the CEC?s Web site (www.energy.ca.gov/reports/index.html).\n\n\nThe attachment below is the final CEC Infrastructure report:\n\n <<FinalCECInfraRpt.pdf>> "

SoCal filed its Advice Letter No. 3015 to implement the CPUC's Dec. 11th decision to unbundle the SoCalGas Transmission and Storage Systems however the filing only addresses Ordering Paragraph Nos. 9-15 of the decision.  This section of the order directs SoCal to outline within their tariff the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement arrangements for allocating stranded costs.  It does not address capacity or open season issues as dictated by the order.  We will investigate the filing with SoCal as to the status of addressing these issues. \n\nA01-10-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  In regard to filing comments on EGA's motion to strike the testimony and related materials on embedded cost-based allocation versus the long-run marginal cost methodology for the hearing on Monday, Jan. 7, 2002, it was decided not to file comments, but continue monitoring the proceeding.  By participating Transwestern will continue to have the option of addressing any of the issues raised by other parties.\n\nCPUC Infrastructure Report.  The Commission has issued its report and assessment of the state's gas infrastructure for the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide reliable amounts of competitively priced gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  \n\n\nSchedule:\n\nWeek of Jan. 7 -  \tOmaha\n"

These are:\n\n\tb.  the terms and effective date of the contract\n\th.  the rate charged in $$/MMbtu\n\nRick - Currently, the effective or execution date is not captured anywhere.  I will need someone (on of the Alma's or Josh) to extract all TW contracts and populate this info onto a spreadsheed.

It's virtually impossible to use the current CBS rate system because at the end of the month, there is a great possibility that these FT rates to the Cal border will be buried into a calculated, blended rate (due to capturing incremental fees for alternate point usage).  Also as I mentioned in a previous e-mail to TK, we need to ensure that the IT rates are updated in the rate system promptly.\n\nDon - After your initial review of the data request, did you have any other concerns regarding data retrieval and automation of the process?

The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5.

The paper is\navailable on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com\n<http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on\nthe paper.\n\nHere is a summary of the paper:\n\n        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter\nelectricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public\nUtilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring\ncompetitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and\nmore choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy\nsuppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.\n\n        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April\n1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster\nfor California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.\nPart of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable\nconcern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity\nindustry. \n\n        Although a few states have decided, based on the California\nexperience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.\nInstead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are\nthat competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for\nCalifornia's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and\nprices affect market outcomes.\n\n        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity\nregulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred\nbeginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance\nto other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity\nindustry. This section makes several points: \n\n*\tMaintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new\ngeneration to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned\nto meet growing loads. \n\n*\tEnsure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural\ngas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,\nmaintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large\nregional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. \n\n*\tEncourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and\nvoluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale\nmarkets). \n\n*\tCreate honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with\nartificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to\noffer retail services without favoring individual competitors. \n\n*\tEncourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply\nand price risks. \n\n*\tCreate efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,\nancillary services, and transmission congestion. \n\n*\tMonitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and\nvertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and\ntransmission). \n\n\n        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and\nprices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer\nefficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve\nreliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing\noptions. \n\n        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is\nturning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because\nelectricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is\nour most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy\nto operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a\nreal-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the\nsame time. \n\n        Although the problems that have occurred in California are\nsubstantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should\nfocus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and\naccept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to\nrecognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond\nthe boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and\nwholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to\nhave competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces\ntime varying prices. \n\n        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for\nwholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will\nenjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and\nprice-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability\nservices will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,\nand the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants\nwill be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. \n\nEric\n----------------------------------------------\nEric Hirst \nConsulting in Electric-Industry Restructuring\n106 Capital Circle\nOak Ridge, TN 37830\n*865-482-5470 (phone & fax)    *Eric@EHirst.com\nhttp://www.EHirst.com <http://www.ehirst.com/> "

I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.\n\nWe are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.\n\nWhile terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.\n\nI appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.\n\nKen"

The huge sums came from their investment of nearly $3 million in the\n> partnership LJM2 Co-Investment LP, the Journal claims. \n> \n> The limited partnership was set up in December 1999 mainly to do business\n> with Enron, and big-time investors include Wachovia Corp., General\n> Electric\n> Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp., and Credit Suisse First Boston,\n> according to the account in the paper. \n> \n> The gains from the deals were revealed in a report to partnership\n> investors\n> dated April 30, which was signed by general partner Fastow, says the\n> Journal. \n> \n> Enron officials had no comments for the Journal in regard to the LJM2\n> partnership document. However, it would seem there might be some concerns\n> as\n> Fastow, as Enron's CFO, has fiduciary duties to Enron shareholders. \n> \n> On Tuesday, Enron stunned investors with the announcement that it had\n> taken\n> a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter due mostly to write-downs of\n> lousy investments, resulting in a $618 million loss for the three-month\n> period. \n> \n> Downgrades Up, Upgrades Down\n> According to Moody's Investors Service, credit rating downgrades of U.S.\n> corporations far exceeded upgrades in the third quarter. In a press\n> release,\n> Moody's noted that the ratings of 125 companies were knocked down in the\n> quarter, while only 43 corporations received credit upgrades. This is the\n> 14th consecutive quarter that downgrades have exceeded upgrades. \n> \n> Among junk credits, 93 issuers were downgraded--versus only 19\n> upgrades--in\n> the third quarter. The ratings news wasn't so bad for investment-grade\n> firms, however, which experienced 32 downgrades, versus 24 upgrades. \n> \n> Recently, Moody's reported a third-quarter surge in junk defaults. The\n> hardest hit sectors were airlines, telecommunications, motor vehicle\n> parts,\n> and chemical companies, while the strongest sector was oil and gas. \n> \n> Moody's senior economist John Puchalla said an increase in risk aversion,\n> a\n> loss of revenues, and the potential changes in demand away from travel and\n> tourism-related industries, have weakened credit quality since the\n> September\n> 11 terrorist strikes. \n> \n> Moody's also pointed out that most aggregate measures of corporate debt\n> protection remain stronger now than in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n> \"The\n> much stronger credit position of financial institutions also diminishes\n> the\n> likelihood of a broad-based credit crunch,\" noted a Moody's press release.\n> \n> \n> The press release also stated that \"the lowest short- to intermediate-\n> term\n> borrowing costs and one of the biggest infusions of fiscal stimulus since\n> the mid-1960s, as well as the fastest annual expansion of M2, or financial\n> liquidity, since 1983, signal the return of above-average expenditures\n> growth by 2002's second half.\" \n> \n> Read On!

To do this, we have laid out the following steps:\n \n- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)\n- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)\n- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers\n- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise\n \nPlease confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.\n \nLastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.\n \nThanks in advance\n\nChris Abel \nManager, Risk Controls \nGlobal Risk Operations \nchris.abel@enron.com <mailto:chris.abel@enron.com> \n713.853.3102 \n\n \n "

"Thanks for making the changes on the P&L and fixed price positions report.  Can you also change the natural gas basis position by trader report from MacKay to Lambie?"
