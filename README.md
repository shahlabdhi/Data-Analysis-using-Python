### Feedback 
- Excellent work!
- Question 5: Think about what will in the list after the entire loop if you use <br>
  > words_txt1 = [x.lower() for x in words_txt1]
- Question 7: Please check your result and see why ‘q’ is missing.
- Question 8: First, you make the same mistake as it in Question 5. Second, isalpha() will remove the words like ‘4ever,gr8’ as well.
